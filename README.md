# ðŸ¥“ Baconator (local) ðŸ¥“

this app sets up a static site generator on localhost. Read more about it [here](https://www.propublica.org/nerds/).

A quick note on the name --  
To generate static HTML = "baking a page out".  
So what was `bake-n-ator` quickly became `baconator`.  
Also, naming things is hard Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯.

## Set-up

### Pre-requisites
 - [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Running the app  
To run, clone repo and use *docker-compose*, from the root:

```
> git clone https://github.com/propublica/fakenator.git
> cd fakenator/
> docker-compose build &&  docker-compose up
```

Site will be accessible at http://localhost:8888/

It fronts www.propublica.org

The first time you browse to a page, it will 404 and queue page for generation. The page will refresh after 5 seconds and load the cached content. On subsequent visits to the same page, this app will serve from cache. If a cache row has expired, its corresponding page will be queued for regeneration.

## Baconator Elements

**Reverse Proxy**  
[this script](https://github.com/propublica/fakenator/blob/master/src/reverseProxy.php), which is [configured](https://github.com/propublica/fakenator/blob/master/src/.htaccess) to receive all requests to the server.  

**Data Store**  
mysql table, defined [here](https://github.com/propublica/fakenator/blob/master/helpers/createTables.sql#L5). Houses cache, served by the reverse proxy script.  

**Queue Worker**  
[this script](https://github.com/propublica/fakenator/blob/master/src/queueWorker.php), which is [set up](https://github.com/propublica/fakenator/blob/master/helpers/entrypoint.sh#L12-L16) to run on loop.  

**Queue**  
mysql table, defined [here](https://github.com/propublica/fakenator/blob/master/helpers/createTables.sql#L15). Holds pages to be regenerated -- managed by queue worker script.  

**Origin**  
Set up to be www.propublica.org, but [swap in](https://github.com/propublica/fakenator/blob/master/src/queueWorker.php#L93) your own!   


## Under the Hood

### Accessing the database
In order to access the DB, the docker rig needs to be running, and you'll need a MySQL client, configured with the following:  
 - **server**: 127.0.0.1
 - **user**: docker
 - **pass**: docker
 - **port**: 33306
 - **schema**: cache

To see all your cached pages:
```
select * from `cache`.`dataStore`
```

To invalidate all caches (so that they will be regenerated after the next visit to that page):
```
update `cache`.`dataStore` set `expiry` = "0" where `key` like '%'
```

To delete all caches:
```
truncate `cache`.`dataStore`
```

To view pending items to be generated in cache:
```
select *  from `cache`.`queue`
```
